			My name is Aaron Porath and I am a senior at Mayfield High Shool. This is my first year at Mayfield, I originally went to Benedictine High School before transferring. At Benedictine I taught myself html because we were all given laptops. I'm happy to be here at Mayfield. I've made many new friends and enjoy all my classes.
